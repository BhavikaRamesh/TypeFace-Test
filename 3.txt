The API I would use will be REST API as it is lightweight.
Create a table with columns userID, APIID, currentMaxResponseTime, AvgResponse, and 24hrResponse.
Everytime a user hits API, async process to calculate average response time till then will be stored in 1hr response field.
For example, for first time, user 1 hits API takes 60 sec, then keep 60 sec in 1hr column
For second time, user hits API takes 57 sec, then avg will be 58.5 sec and update in column.
1hr response will be (current value + existing) / 2. 
After every hr, update 24hrResponse column.
For currentMaxResponseTime column, first insert min value of response time and then insert the maximum response time.
